          <p class="text-white-75 font-weight-light mb-5">We are foreign exchange and international payments specialists with many years experience in banking. 
						In the last few years, we have watched with interest as bank and non-bank providers have changed the way they advertise their services. 
						From the largest banks to the most aggressive fintechs, the message is always the same - transparent charges and better rates.</br></br>
						But there’s a problem - many are misleading you and you have no way of verifying what you’ve been told. 
						In fact, some of the providers who are most vocal about how you’ve been getting ripped off until they came along are often the most misleading of all. 
						How do they get away with it? 
						Easily, because it’s almost impossible for consumers or corporates to verify what they have actually been charged for an international payment. 
						This is due to the way that the foreign exchange market works.  We’ve provided more information about the issue here. </br></br>
						We developed Trace FX to enable anyone, from a retail consumers to corporate Treasurers, to understand and verify what they’ve been charged for international payments. 
						This will enable you to keep your provider honest and, if appropriate, seek financial redress for any overcharging and / or choose a better provider. 
						And maybe, one day, real-world practice for international payments will catch up to the PR and marketing. </br></br>
						As you will discover using this tool, the more detailed the information you input, specifically about the time you executed your international payment, the more accurate the result will be. 
						The more accurate the result, the better equipped you will be to deal with any over-charging, negotiate a better deal in future and/or to assess alternative providers. 
						If you only know the date you executed an international payment and not the time it will be harder to spot over-charging, though not necessarily impossible, and you will not know exactly what you paid. 
						</br></br>
						We don’t charge for the tools available on this site and we are not affiliate marketers. 
						We do, however, offer industrial strength tooling and professional support if you make a large volume of international payments. 
						If you would like to discuss this, please get in touch.
