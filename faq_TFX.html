          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4"><h5>Payment Fees:</h5> The first is through a payment fee.  This is a fixed amount per payment, for example £20.  The fee varies depending on the payment infrastructure used, for example the SWIFT network or the local payment infrastructure.  Although the fees for a SWIFT payment tend to be higher than the fees for a local payment, the payment fee does not necessarily reflect the actual cost of processing the payment.
</br></br>
Many providers, particularly non-banks, advertise 0% commission or zero fees.  Others offer to waive the fee if you are sending a minimum amount - say, £3000.  0% commissions and zero fees can be particularly misleading, as will become clear when we discuss the second way these providers make money.  In fact, it is a mystery to many in the industry why the FCA in the UK, and regulators in other jurisdictions, do not take any action against this blatant miss-selling and failure to treat customers fairly.  It’s not like the people who work at the FCA don’t see these ads - they catch the tube, read the newspaper, travel through airports and walk down high streets too.  
</br></br>
The second is through the foreign exchange rate applied to your international payment.  For most providers, this is where they make most of their money.  This is why they offer 0% commissions and zero fees.  It’s also why it so misleading when they advertise, to retail customers who do not understand foreign exchange, that their service is being provided at 0% commission or zero fee.  It’s not hard to see why they offer 0% commission when they can simply take a bigger margin on the foreign exchange rate which is much less visible to the customer.
</br></br>
Before we move onto how providers make money off the foreign exchange rate, it’s worth understanding another aspect of the 0% commission or zero fee proposition.  When the provider is using the SWIFT network, the sender can designate whether (i) they pay the fee, (ii) the receiver (known as the beneficiary) pays the fee, or (iii) the fee is shared.  Some providers tell the customer that they will not charge a fee but ‘other banks may charge a fee’.  In such cases, the provider has simply designated that the beneficiary will pay the fee (without telling you) and the receiving bank will simply deduct the fee from the final amount received.  This is misleading and the customer inevitably finds that less money arrives than they intended.  It also means you do not know how much will be charged, which is a significantly worse experience than a provider who clearly states and charges you the fee up front.
</br></br></br>
<h5>Foreign Exchange Rates:</h5> The second way that providers make money from international payments is by applying a margin to the foreign exchange (FX) rate.  Some providers clearly state what margin they will apply (usually expressed as a percentage, say 0.75%) though most do not.  
</br></br>
There are a number of reasons why it is hard for customers to verify that the correct margin has been applied (if the provider stated the margin in advance) or to know what margin was applied at all (if the provider did not state the margin in advance), but the main reason is that FX rates move in real time and may change by over 1% in a day.  If you know what the interbank FX rate was at the time you initiated your international payment, you can check the difference between the interbank FX rate and the FX rate that was used to process your payment.  This would enable you to determine what margin the provider actually applied.  The problem for most customers is that they don’t know what the ‘official’ FX rate was at the time that they initiated their international payment.  Most services that publish historic FX rates simply publish one FX rate for the day.  This might be the rate at the end of the trading day or at another specific time of day, or might be a daily average or some other calculation.  As FX rates move in real time 24 hours per day 5.5 days per week, it is hard for you to know what the ‘official’ rate was at the time you initiated your payment.
